We have already started reaching out to some female therapists our age/younger. Thank you everyone for your kind words and support. \\n\\nSide note: If anyone has recommendations for someone in NC that would be great. \\n\\nMy husband read through everyone\\u2019s comments and when we talked more he now understands what I was trying to say and that it isn\\u2019t that I was trying to keep him from getting recognized for his contributions to our family but rather that it isn\\u2019t right in general for only men to get praise for parenting, but even moreso in the context of a marriage counselor for a couple that is intentional about having an equitable distribution of labor in all areas of our relationship. \\n******\\n\\nMy husband and I, both 32, started seeing a couple's therapist, (m, \\\\~60 yo) about 2 months ago. For some general background, my husband and I have been together since we were 16 and married for 6 years. We have a 3 yo and a 6 month old. We are overall very happy, we are best friends and are committed to breaking generational trauma for ourselves and our kids' sakes. The reason we started seeing a therapist was more of a maintenance/care thing than for any huge glaring issue.\\n\\nSo the comment in question was when I was telling our therapist about our overnight routine with the baby. Baby is breastfed so I wake up to nurse him as needed overnight. My husband sleeps while I nurse and then I let him know when I'm done nursing and he does diaper change and puts baby back in his crib. For some context that will be relevant in a bit, I nursed our first for 2 years and my husband didn't do this with him, this is something I asked him to do with this new baby because it seemed more fair than how things were the first time around. \\n\\nSo, back to me telling the therapist how I hand off baby to husband to change his diaper and get him back to sleep after I nurse him. His jaw dropped and he was offering all kinds of praise to my husband. He then asked me \\\"have you thanked your husband for how he helps you at night?\\\" I said I do, and that I'm grateful to have a husband who helps share the load of taking care of our children. Which is true, I am grateful. But the more I think about it the more his comment rubs me the wrong way. Why is it only me that needs to be grateful for my husband's contributions in caring for our baby overnight? I am also waking up and taking care of the baby. How come he didn't ask my husband if he has thanked me for what I do? It just seems so taken for granted when I do it, but when a man helps all of a sudden I need to jump for joy. After therapy, I shared how I feel about this with my husband I really thought he'd agree with me and see how sexist the therapist's reaction was, but he doesn't see it?! He agrees with the therapist and is now mad at me for making it all about me and feels like I'm trying to steal his spotlight. My thing is, we either both deserve praise for the way we take care of our baby overnight or neither of us deserve praise because we're just doing what is our responsibility. But it can't be praise for him, and none for me because I'm just doing what I'm supposed to.\\n\\nAm I wrong to think our therapist's reaction was rooted in sexism and traditional gender expectations? Does it not highlight the way a woman's contributions to her family are undervalued? It's become an ongoing argument between us, I am starting to feel like it's the therapist and my husband against me since this is not the only comment of this type he's made.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 947,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Women didn't ask to have their freedoms limited, or their identities overshadowed, or to be oppressed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"upvote_ration\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.038073916502647125,\n        \"min\": 0.7,\n        \"max\": 0.99,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 26,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.92\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 994,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://i.redd.it/swmxnagrzd391.jpg\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Male privilege under the Patriarchy?\\n\\nHey /u/yeshras, explain how the woman is the real victim here because reverse sexism and privilege or whatever..

She isn't facing any criminal charges.\\n:/. Dude dodged a bullet. That thing is disgusting. . Don't ever date a chick with a menopause hair-do they are all fucking crazy.. Put her in jail. .

He didn't but someone definitely should. Rich people be crazy.. Effin' Bitch!!!. Is this really a men's rights issue?  \\n\\nThe case was rejected by male judges, the male in the case admitted to a crime and was charged (which makes sense), and there wasn't enough evidence to convict the female.. > she lied in court which is illegal and a hell of lot shittier than breaking a radio\\n\\nYou need proof beyond a reasonable doubt that she lied. The court saying it doesn't believe her enough to sustain a conviction doesn't mean there's strong enough evidence that she's lying.. This is the same situation one of my female friend\\u2019s guy friends are in. She had a beer and ended up having sex with 2 dudes in a room they were planning to have a movie night at a kick back. \\nI wouldn\\u2019t really call her a friend anymore.. she\\u2019s had sex with over 20-30 guys, hooked up with at least 100 strangers, slept over guys houses who she knew were married or engaged when the woman was gone on a trip or something. This girl is 21 btw. \\nSo at the kickback they were having a three-some, and about 30 other people walked in on her getting \\u201cdouble penetrated\\u201d and everyone basically ended up finding out about it at the university. She claims she was drunk and passed out, but everyone who saw says she was 100% fine. She didn\\u2019t want to ruin her image and now she\\u2019s accused them of raping her. \\nI don\\u2019t know these guys that well, but just because they were ACCUSED, they\\u2019ve been suspended from my university for two years (this is supposed to be their last year) and they\\u2019re now under criminal investigation for rape. But Her? She pretty much gets special treatment from the uni now. . Can you say for 100% certain she lied.  He admitted breaking the radio so he is guilty of that. she told her story in court which is clearly not true but she hasn't admitted lying.  Unless she admitted lying she couldn't really be done for perjury because the court cannot say for 100% it didn't happen.  The court has made a JUDGEMENT that they believe him more than her.  They haven't said she is lying they have said he is MORE LIKELY to be telling the truth.  That is why she hasn't been done for anything.. Right! Sorry but she should have to do the bare minimum jail sentence he would have had to serve. Same goes for fake rape accusations. Men, women whatever, you're lying with intent to ruin someone's life. You deserve jail time . because penis is always wrong, penis the only ones with a brain so they shouldve seen it coming according to court\\n. > and she cheated on him, morally one of the worst things you can do.\\n\\nI hate cheaters as much as the next guy but I can think of many things worse than cheating on the moral scale.. That's why mgtow . >  and she cheated on him, morally one of the worst things you can do. Obviously no punishment for the wommen of course!\\n\\nOne of that scenes from film 'Minority Report' which kept me interested for a long time.... > wommen\\n\\nHere, maybe 'man' just actually means 'human' and 'woman' means 'human with womb' or 'wom(bed) (hum)an'.\\n\\nIf so they can stfu about gender neutralising words like workman, manhole etc, because they already *are* gender neutral.. on a long enough timeline, someone gets screwed in this system, and the girl gets in an \\\"accident\\\".  she has this shitty illegal behavior because she fears no consequences.  one day she'll meet a guy who isn't so emasculated that he does nothing.  when men start taking it out on cunts because the law lets them off, they'll fear men again.. >she cheated on him, morally one of the worst things you can do\\n\\nI'll never understand this.\\n\\nI mean, I expect it, don't get me wrong. People think like this, I know they do, I see it all around me. But how on earth does this qualify as serious?\\n\\nHumans have sexual urges, and sometimes they act on them. Why is that the end of the world? Why is it \\\"morally awful?\\\" Why does it automatically mean the end of a relationship? Don't get me wrong, I don't fault an individual for leaving someone after being cheated on. I understand it's a breach of trust if you had the understanding you'd be monogamous. If the person is irresponsible it might present a risk of STDs, but any sexually mature adult that you or I trust shouldn't be making that mistake. But \\\"one of the worst things you can do?\\\" Why, because it makes you worry about your sexual prowess and you can't handle self-doubt? \\n\\nI'd rather my girlfriend cheat on me than break my radio. I mean, don't get me wrong, if she's cheating because I simply can't satisfy  her needs and she won't tell me that, it's a big deal, because it means our relationship is based on lies and won't work in the long run... but if she's on vacation and some hot guy turns her on, shit, I'd rather that happen than that I have to replace a $300 radio. So what? She had sex.. Lady feminist judge that must hate men? Fucking hate psychotic bitches. . At least her face is out there so all men can be warned to stay away. We need a Mens rule to dating book. First rule google the girls name. . Well said.. I'm pretty sure this is being hit by the bullet.  Dodging a bullet would mean identifying the crazy well before it becomes harmful.. Hopefully he takes her to civil court. >  But she lied under oath, perjury, falsified a police statement, defamation of character, and so many others that easily add up to MORE time and fines than what he is currently being ordered to serve/pay\\n\\nExcept that there isn't enough evidence to bring a perjury charge.. Can you say for 100% certain she lied.  He admitted breaking the radio so he is guilty of that. she told her story in court which is clearly not true but she hasn't admitted lying.  Unless she admitted lying she couldn't really be done for perjury because the court cannot say for 100% it didn't happen.  The court has made a JUDGEMENT that they believe him more than her.  They haven't said she is lying they have said he is MORE LIKELY to be telling the truth.  That is why she hasn't been done for anything.\\n\\nNow if he wanted to go through the civil courts for slander, maybe, but he would need to raise that.. Her bio is still up in Cambridge University's page.... .. Because you need actual evidence that she lied. Right now all they have is his word. Not enough to get a conviction on.. Defamation is a civil matter and is not a crime. He would have to prove that he suffered financially or otherwise (which is more difficult than it sounds) and fraud isn't the type of crime they'd look at. It would be more attempting to pervert the course of justice, perjury or wasting police time. . \\\"The Maddow\\\". Short hair girls are my weakness.  I'd probably still date her.  . Came here to point out that quote. I stopped reading at that point. Has he not yet realized that this is the problem? . ... you do realize feminists do not deny false rape accusations can be a thing, right?. Seriously. [Here's the archive.](http://archive.is/I342q). This is being hit by the bullet.  Dodging a bullet means avoiding the crazy before it causes harm.. Then put her in prison.. Sooo many times I've thought \\\"Man, if I was gay, my romantic life would be so much more peaceful and happy\\\" \\n\\nBut... you can't force yourself to be gay. So instead I just went MGTOW and walked away from romantic relationships with women. I refuse to put myself in a vulnerable position to be fucked over by some vindictive, manipulative scorned women and the gynocentric courts that enable them. \\n\\nIt's already happened once with an ex. Found out she was cheating on me throughout our entire relationship. I ignored so many red flags (mood swings, violent outburst, emotional abuse and manipulation) but I was \\\"in love\\\" and basically a fool. When I broke things off with her, she smashed in the side of my car, keyed my car weeks later, and harassed me for 6 months... literally calling and texting my phone hundreds of times every day. \\nEDIT: I went to the police about the damages to my car, about the harassment (with proof) and they wouldn't help me. The only thing that got her to stop was me threatening to file a RO with the courts.. I pointed out how I had saved every call and text and that when I got the order approved, It would probably mess up her career... Only when she realized the possibility of *her* facing consequences for the shit she was pulling , did she decide to stop and leave me alone. \\n\\nTurns out she was undiagnosed bipolar... later on down the road, after she got the diagnosis she texted me telling about it, and she said \\\"I told you I couldn't control my emotions. It wasn't my fault\\\".... yeah, how convenient for you bitch. \\n\\n(And my story is tame compared to the horror stories you read about here or the MGTOW sub)\\n\\nNever again.... never again. People who like tortoises. I think this proves that if you're going to go down for something, you might as well pick a hotter, younger model. At least get some value out of it. She's kind of dog-faced and has terrible skin.. You're seriously asking this? \\n\\n- This example highlights that women make false accusations for a variety of reasons. In this case, the woman cheated and used false accusations to avoid embarrassment and shame when her family would find out she had an affair (this reason is actually one of the more common reasons women make false accusations. This same exact thing happened with [Nicole Yovino](https://www.google.com/amp/www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4611776/amp/Woman-faces-2-years-prison-fake-rape-claims.html)  and there's even an anecdote above the thread of another similar case)\\n\\n- this example highlights that .... literally, all it takes is a woman's word to get police to not only arrest, but take a man to court and try to get a conviction. \\n\\n- This example highlights the case of a woman using false accusations as blackmail ...  but receiving no punishment for it.\\n\\nThere's a couple more reasons I could give why this is relevant to Men's rights... but I'm assuming you got the point by now ya? . Woman lies in court and doesn't get charged. Man, who the lies are about, has to pay the court fees. Trashing a radio, which I'm assuming he gifted to her, is a bigger crime than lieing in court. Sounds ass-backwards to me. Not in civil court. . And cheating is not illegal. So let's drop the pitchforks and be happy. He got charged for what he did, and that's fine.. > Gets drunk and decides to have 3 some. Gets caught and humiliated. Instead of owning up to what she did, she lies and makes false accusations which results in 2 innocent men being suspended from school and possibly having their lives ruined..\\n\\n> I wouldn't really call her a friend anymore \\n\\nWouldn't really? So does that mean you still associate with this piece of shit? I'd hope you wouldn't want to be friends with someone that has no problem hurting and exploiting others in order to save face and avoid taking responsibility for her actions. \\n. Fucking insane. Every other indulgent behavior is rightly considered a vice or an illness, but fucking dozens and dozens of strangers is somehow not evidence of a significant mental imbalance. . I can't even believe how differently men and women get treated when it comes to this stuff. That it is allowed to happen is unbelievable, that no one stops the blatant bias towards women being able to use rape allegations to get back at people is unconscionable. :-( I want to be a men's rights advocate, it's gone way, way too far...\\ud83d\\ude33\\ud83d\\ude33. Can we see the news story on this?. > she\\u2019s had sex with over 20-30 guys, hooked up with at least 100 strangers\\n\\nYour numbers seem a bit contradictory there.. She's definitely done a lot of defamation if none of what she said was true. I don't think you need beyond reasonable doubt of her lying to convict someone of defamation, especially if her intentions to ruin him has been proven.. I'm with you, save one minor correction: it can be argued that they don't believe him more than here, they simply don't think there's enough evidence to convict him in that charge. It's a minor difference, but I think it's important when it comes to the philosophy of the law.\\n\\nOtherwise, spot on. There's no evidence that she's committed perjury.\\n\\nAlthough I will add - if her story was considered inconsistent, isn't that sufficient grounds to rule that he shouldn't have to pay her court fees? . It's still bullshit, my ex chested on me, told on in thr car after I picked her up from her friends, tried to make me crash because she knew I was gonna a dump her, smashed up my glasses, attacked me, ripped my clothes, and the police basically said fuck off. . >They haven't said she is lying they have said he is MORE LIKELY to be telling the truth.\\n\\nNot if England is like the US. A not-guilty verdict says nothing about the veracity of anything unless its a perjury prosecution. It means that there wasn't enough evidence to convict on the specific charges. That's it.. >Following the one-day trial, magistrates handed Baron a conditional discharge of 12 months. He was also ordered to pay \\u00a3620 in court costs, which included \\u00a3300 in compensation. Miss Cooke will not face any criminal charges. \\n\\nJesus. So what youre implying is that you prefer women not worrying about consequences than having equality. The darkest timeline. You deserve to get cucked if you don't care. Comments like these are why I have a hard time posting on this sub.\\n\\n\\\"Lady feminist judge\\\" and \\\"hate psychotic bitches\\\" sitting at 40 upvotes.\\n\\nThe magistrates of Huntingdon court basically rejected the case - they're not named in this article, but there's only 7 of them.\\n\\n\\nTheir names are a matter of public record and are \\\"Rondall, Darrel, Dan, Daniel, John, Danne and Mike\\\".\\n\\nedit: Thanks for the gold. That said, I wish you hadn't. Because I'm an idiot, not because I don't appreciate the gesture. The above magistrates are the ones in Hunting**t**on. Because I can't type.\\nI can't immediately find the serving magistrates for Hunting**d**on.\\n\\nI hope my original point about not leaping to sexist conclusions and 'being the bigger man' still stands - and I'll leave my post up, but.. yeah. I need to spellcheck.. its the UK in general, they always side with women when possible.. We need a website that tracks 'bad women'. Women have that for 'bad men'.\\n\\n. R/theredpill. Being hit by the bullet would be after the part where they pronounce you Man and Wife.. So what you're saying is... that the court has sided with him in saying that this event did not happen, an event she said did happen, but.. but they also aren't saying she lied? What kind of nonsense is that? \\n\\nIf I say the ball is green and you say it's blue, then a judge says I was right it's green, in what world would people think you didn't lie about the color of the ball?. I see that damn patriarchy is hard at work again keeping her down... . If one person's word is enough to jail men for rape, it should be enough to jail one b-tch for perjury, fraud, and blackmail.. Isn't there a charge for wasting court and police time and resources?. Really?  Because if I find out a girl cheated on someone, I dump that shit quicker than a fatty.  Once a cheater, always a cheater.. You realize that many do?\\n\\nAnd those who acknowledge it happens think either it's a good learning experience for men or at the very worst shouldn't be punished because it might discourage other women from coming forward? \\n\\n\\nBut anyway it's undeniable that false accusations predominately harm men.\\n\\n\\nYou've claimed everything that harms men is really about misogyny.\\n\\n\\nSo do your thing, explain how this is really oppression of women under the patriarchy on display here.. FYI yeshras linked this to AMR under an alt. So expect the vote tallies to organically change.\\n\\n\\nAlso be carful about private info, that's a known doxxing sub.. I have told many of these false accusation stories to feminists I know and they do deny they are true, one actually said that she believed in one but thinks that it never happens beside that one. . Ahhh, the classic no true feminist...I mean Scotsman, fallacy. . Or penguins. Or iguanas :/. I don't think she is bad, but she definitely does not have the requisite level of hot to be able to get away with this, at least not socially.\\n\\nI think that bridges have been burned especially now with the fact she cheated while on a research trip, I foresee opportunities getting withdrawn, other publications have been less sensationalist but she does not look much better in them.\\n\\nI hope the fuck was worth it, she detonated her social and academic life.. Yes but men do all of those things, too. \\n\\nThis case doesn't even involve unfair treatment based on gender - there wasn't enough evidence and refusing to admit that that was the reason she wasn't charged is just being immature. \\n\\nI love that we live in an age where \\\"racism isn't real\\\" but rampant toxic sexism is everywhere because \\\"we just know it is\\\" even though you can't ever prove that you're even being victimized. .\",\n          \"Maybe you can say it's a male privilege to not have a large influential group telling you to be scared to do basic things and fear half the population, but men are still more likely to be assaulted. I think there are alot of areas where it's really not smart for either gender to go walking.. Fear of violence doesn\\u2019t correlate to the risk of violence. They never seem to grasp that.. Jesus christ that post and comment section.. It should also be mentioned that men are almost as likely to be victims of human trafficking with 49 percent of the victims being Male. okay but since when does anyone feel completely safe going for a walk at midnight (i'm assuming alone). In third world countries nobody feels safe walking alone in the dark.. Nothing at all is stopping any female from going for a walk at midnight.  Aren't you a strong and independent woman?. These type of \\\"oh yeah well we have it worse >:(\\\" type of posts are really starting to irritate me. Look we get it, it's dangerous for both genders. I as a dude can get get mugged and murdered but these types of comments and posts don't do shit. It's like a dick measuring contest mixed with a pity party.\\n\\nA stupid tweet isn't the bane of our cause and it's a waste if anger and energy. Some chick in twitter saying dumb shit doesn't mean anything and there's much more important things to get up in arms about. There's a lot more important things to be advocating for. This post isn't about men's rights, this post is about stroking your ego because some dumbass attached a demeaning phrase to a tweet. Sure she's not helping anyone by saying \\\"male privilege\\\" but that doesn't negate that fact that it is dangerous for women to go out by themselves at night. \\n\\nJust as it is for men. \\n\\nSo why do you feel the need to say these kind of \\\"dur hur us too Stoopid woman\\\" like come the fuck on.\\n\\n This isn't men's rights\\n\\nThis is stroking your fucking ego. True. Men are 2x as likely to be randomly assaulted.  But it doesn\\u2019t fit the feminist narrative so it\\u2019s ignored. Bitch please I stopped going out at night cause Im scared I'll get randomly jumped. Lol imagine going on walks. It's not male privilege that does that, it's common fucking sense. The actual chances of being a victim of violence are vanishingly small.\\n\\nAlso, men don't give in to their feelings, so it's not like we don't have fear we just tend to disregard it, because most of the time it's wrong.. It isn't a competition. These are both social issues that should be taken care of accordingly.. Girls will say, \\\"Female privilege doesn't exist\\\" and then go and get an abortion, regardless if her partner wanted the child or not.. This always makes me laugh - I've never met a bloke in their right mind  who thinks to themselves, at midnight, 'you know what, I really fancy a pleasure walk right now; Fuck the fact I've got to get up for work in about 5 hours or so and that I can't see past my hand as it's pitch black outside, I'll go anyway!'\\nI know it's anecdotal but none of my guy friends do this, I've never done this, have any of you? About the only times I've ventured out at that time of night is when I've been on my way home from somewhere local, or the wife has decided she desperately wanted something that couldn't wait until morning (guilt kicks in and even though you don't necessarily want to go, you bite the bullet and do).\\nIt'd be genuinely interesting to get an honest answer out of some of these women as to how many of them have actually, personally, had a bad experience, and by that I mean robbed or actually assaulted  while out late at night as opposed to saying they 'felt' scared or intimidated, as I think we all do feel that way when we have to venture out at times like that sometimes.. Let's ignore the fact that men are more likely to be assaulted, basically any time or hour they leave the house. Lets ignore the fact that men leave the house fully knowing there are risks to it, but will do so regardless not only because they do not let fear run their lives(and, if they did, they would be branded as cowards and ineligible by women, so they are strongly conditioned not to show fear) but also because they probably they put less value into their own lives and safety(because that is what men are socially conditioned to do, specifically by women who expect men to put women's safety about their own). \\n\\nLets talk about the fact that when men do go out, they typically go out being prepared to run/fight for their lives if they have to. Men train, they go to the gym, they take martial arts classes, they study their environments, they find the quickest routes, and they try to keep a low profile. \\n\\nMeanwhile, you have women who leave the house in the middle of the night in high heels and tight skirts, make no effort to learn how to be physically competent, don't lift/train(or, when they do, half-ass it because they \\\"don't want to get bulky\\\"), have absolutely no spacial awareness and literally make no effort towards improving their odds of safety. Some times, those women are the same women complaining that they don't feel safe at night or trying to argue that men are privileged for some kind of imaginary imperviousness to harm. \\n\\nThere's a great deal of obliviousness, or lack of self-awareness, and hypocrisy from women trying to make these arguments when you have so many women doing everything in their power to be easy victims and yet still never actually coming to any harm over the course of their entire life-times.. You have the right and privilege to leave the communal cave and patrol for dangerous beasts outside in the dark.   \\nI'll bet not one woman, ever, clamoured for this privilege.. Girls will say female privilege doesnt exist and then falsely charge a guy for rape and win the case. And then get robbed or killed. I did that when I was younger. Got brutally beat up and robbed. So what\\u2019s her point?. Are we gonna act like most victims don\\u2019t know the person who assault them? Or the setting usually is at like private parties, and what not? Do people honestly believe rapists and murderers lay all night in bushes, just waiting for a lonely woman to walk by at 3am??. Honestly, everyone should be fucking scared of walking at night. If someone isn't, something really is fucking wrong with them (or theyre lying) because there are horrible people out there that will do horrible things to both men and women. Everyone should be weary of strangers staring or following them, not just girls. \\\"You guys can walk at midnight\\\" yeah and you guys can too, its just most guys either \\n\\n1. fight back \\n\\n2. dont live to tell the story \\n\\n3. stay silent because people do silence our voices, especially other men (which in itself is a problem). \\n\\nEveryone should be scared, thats the problem in my opinion, No one should be scared going outside at night. Theres countries where everyone is safe at night. We need to strive for that rather than \\\"debunking privledge\\\" between any persons. We need a safe community and society as a whole where this is not a problem for either (or each) gender, boys or girls, male or female, and everyone in between. \\n\\n\\\"Male Privledge\\\" yeah I want equal privledge where I'm safe outside and not fearing my life. Maybe its because I have bad anxiety but quite frankly this isn't a point to be made. Society is flawed, we all know this, and if we keep fighting over made up shit like gender privledge (in 2020, i understand that there was systemic discrimination against woman in the past) and instead fought against our government to do whats right and fix the problems within our society like:\\n\\n\\n- Mental health funding\\n\\n- Police training \\n\\n- Healthcare\\n\\n- Putting people who are criminals in jail and rehab'ing them\\n\\n- Having a safe community\\n\\n- Equality for all\\n\\n- Literally too many things to fix, etc\\n\\n\\ninstead we're fighting over dumb shit that majority of which is overstretched.\\n\\nSorry for this long rant. I'm very tired.. I\\u2019m a woman and I\\u2019d go on a walk right now at 3 AM, no problem. \\n\\nBut I\\u2019m sleepy.. A woman is much safer on the street than a man. People intervene and protect women. The law always sides with women. There\\u2019s a stigma to hitting women. \\nNo one defends a man if he\\u2019s being attacked. Men are fodder in every way imaginable.. The main phallacy of this narrative is that, even though most offenders are male, not most males are offenders. Not even close to that. \\n\\nReseach shows that violent crimes are committed mostly by persistent offenders:\\n\\n https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3969807/\\n1% is accountable for 63% of violent crimes according research. \\n\\nAs numbers show, the percentage of males that are violent offenders is so low in comparison to the whole group that is immoral to label half of the population using this as a concept.. When they were rescuing people by helicopter from the fires in California, it was \\u201cwomen and children first\\u201d. \\n\\nSo much privilege. The privilege to burn to death because you are expendable.. I didn't know it was a privilege to get jumped at 1130 at night, have my skull cracked open, and spend 3 weeks in intensive care and have bad cognitive abilities for the next 12 months because I felt like an ice cream and the store was 2km away.. Men are also far more likely to commit violent crimes by a significant difference which is kind of an important part of this argument.. Women will say that they don't have privilege, but will not only take their kids to a playground, but actively talk to strange kids.\\n\\nhttps://goodmenproject.com/ethics-values/im-dad-creep-dkz/. Well. I've been put in a police list for walking midnight with a girl friend when i was 16 because police though i was kidnaping her. I hope walking during midnight doesn't make me problems when i search for a job for the rest of my life.. Yeah I totally don\\u2019t carry a weapon on me or anything. The reverse would be: \\\"Women will say 'female privilege doesn't exist' and then marry a guy richer than her.\\\"\\n\\nOr another perspective: a lot of the men I see out past midnight are fixing the roads and water mains keeping society functioning.. It's people like this who hurt the women in 3rd world countries that are actually in danger if they go out at night.. I am a guy, and I would never walk alone at midnight.. Do not go to the crossposted sub and vote or comment. Brigading and vote manipulation are against Reddit's rules.\\n\\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/MensRights) if you have any questions or concerns.*. Its because I carry a gun, like I think anyone who ever fears for their safety should.. Female privilege of being unaware of the risks that men face; the irony of her statement is palpable.. She's both misses and concedes the part where men are expected to bail their asses out of everything, yet men have zero authority.. That's because I don't take my midnight walks down \\\"Crime Boulevard\\\" while broadcasting my sexuality, money, and lack of situational awareness.. Eh both sexes can face some shit while walking alone at night. It's male privilege to not have neurosis?  \\n\\n\\nOk then.... I listen to a lot of user submitted \\u201cscary stories\\u201d on YouTube while I work. I realized a while back most of them are females describing pretty innocuous situations where a socially awkward male is just trying to get their attention.  If you just imagine the female being interested and receptive to the advance, the story becomes romantic lol.. Idk about you guys but even I'm scared of going out in midnight alone. Who isnt somewhat scared to go for a walk at night? And besides, night time walks in urban areas are a bit shit. A good midnight walk is somewhere quiet, open and dark, so you can see the stars.. i still can't understand how women being physically weaker makes men evil\\nfor real!!!!. girls be like 'female privilege doesn't exist\\\" and then rob him of his children and financial security. When I was in college I carried a night stick with me after dark and I\\u2019m a 6\\u20191\\u201d, 235 pound man. Women don\\u2019t have a monopoly on fearing their safety when walking alone at night.. Who the fuck goes on walks in the middle of the night. Just because some men do it doesn't mean it's a good idea.\\n\\nMen tend to engage in riskier behaviors than women. Sometimes we are rewarded for it, sometimes we suffer tremendously. It comes down to the possibility of reward vs. how little some men value ourselves sometimes, or at least how little we consider our own value.. Knowing how to read crime statistics is a privilege.. Honestly, everyone\\u2019s lack of exposure to experience is showing here. I\\u2019ve lived in New York for 4 years and my fianc\\u00e9e for 3. I\\u2019ve rarely felt unsafe walking home at night in places like Washington Heights, Harlem, and Flatbush. Whereas if my fianc\\u00e9e is walking alone it is all but guaranteed that she will be verbally assaulted in some way. This is true for many women in NYC, and men tend not to know too much about it if they aren\\u2019t the ones perpetrating it.\\n\\nThis sub has gone too far, how you can turn this around to be a pity part for men is pathetic. Been a long time subscriber and this is simply the straw that broke the camels back. This is no place to discuss hardships and solutions for problems unique to men. This is a sub now centered around attempting to discredit any females experience, and out-woe them. \\n\\nUnsubbing to get this garbage off my feed.. It\\u2019s safer than interacting with women these days as they can just accuse me for sexual crimes.. Chicks will say \\\"female privilege doesn't exist\\\" and then go to the club with no money.. Implying men can't. That doesn\\u2019t even count as privilege though. A privilege is something given to you by a higher authority, not being raped is not so. \\n\\n(This is without even mentioning the higher violence rates). I\\u2019m a girl and I\\u2019ve walked around at midnight plenty of times almost daily even when I was 13 and I grew up in Philadelphia (not such a safe place). I mean, it was and is still a dangerous place to walk at night (with certain areas being much worse), but it\\u2019s dangerous for everyone and not just women. Men would be robbed, shot/stabbed and killed so often there that, unfortunately, most people just stopped caring and see it as a normal event like a rainy day.. Some girls will say men are the only ones with privilege and then not get drafted.. It conufses me why this sub is ready to understand discrimination against men yet unwilling to acknowledge discrimination against women. Both can exist at the same time. Let's be   \\nsmart y'all.. 78.7% of murder victims are men. I can't take a walk at midnight either\\n\\nThat shit does suck. I guess it depends what color the guy is. I carry a huge fixed blade knife everywhere i go because ive been mugged too many times. I'm still worried that I'll have to fight a bitch. But having the means to do so doesn't make me privileged because of my physiology. \\n\\nWhat the fuck do these people think privilege is?. Not in my neighborhood would I go for a walk at night.. Men can make the same arguments \\u2018\\u2019I am always so scared to go outside knowing i am 9 times more likely to get arrested\\u2019\\u2019. I think there\\u2019s a bit of a trade off here. If I go on a walk at midnight, I\\u2019m more fearful of being jumped than I am of being raped.. I'm not going on a walk at midnight, fuck that. I don't want to die. Girls will say \\\"Female privilege doesn't exist\\\" then go on to take advantage of justice system bias against her ex. I don't understand people who think men just...go for walks? It's still dangerous out there for us. Every male victim of assault occurring after midnight:\\\"In hindsight, if I had only used my male powers this wouldn't have happened.\\\". All that does is prove there is a physical difference between the sexes, and that women are aware of it. Has nothing to do with \\u201cprivilege\\u201d unless you consider being exposed to exponentially more random acts of violence a \\u201cprivilege\\u201d. Even though you're more likely to be attacked on the street, also \\\"white people Twitter\\\" or \\\"black people Twitter' don't understand what segregation is.. Wait. I AM IMMORTAL?. My cousin posted this and agreed with it.\\n\\nShe's got a court case for assault incoming. She'll likely never do time because I'm in the UK where Judges don't jail women.\\n\\nNot only is she the privileged one, but she's probably one of the more dangerous people you could bump into at night.. What is so bad about men going on a midnight walk?. Women can also do that, infact they're safer because most violent crimes happen to men, being safe on the streets in the night is a female privilage.. Literally almost got maced by 6 guys in broad daylight with people around us on a busy walking trail. I don't think my gender had to do with it.. I read this earlier and thought, you know, what about male blacks, or male Jews?  Anti semitism is still an issue in the US and the black one should be obvious, an entire gender is not safe just because they're of their genitals. I mean, way to just disregard an entire genders issues just because some men are capable of defending themselves in confrontation.. Men do a lot of stupid things irrationally in spite of the danger. They also suffer for their recklessness and are more often the victims of assaults, muggings and other violent non-rape crimes.. A guy going for a walk at midnight is statistically more likely to be attacked, than a woman going for a walk at midnight; which is reflected in the stats on Men being making up something like 78% of victims of violence.\\n\\nTherefore, her argument is presupposed on a false assumption.. Anyone here ever get raped?. And when it happens most passers by would try their best to stay out of it. Mean while everyone will come to the rescue if it's a woman. I am 190lbs and don't go ANYWHERE not strapped. In free states that allow lawful defense the privilege is the same. Defend yourself with the best tools available. In the USA, that tool is NOT muscle.. I sure do love being stronger than women?. It's a myth that women get attacked at night. Even feminists will tell you, rapist know their victims.\\n\\nWomen really say they don't have any privileges then proceed to have their life paid for just because the government thinks they shouldn't be responsible for a child they can't care for.. 1.) Men are more likely than women to be the victim of a violent crime.  \\n\\n2.) Get a concealed weapons permit, buy a decent carry pistol, and live in a state with sane self defense/gun laws. Hollow point bullets don\\u2019t care about the size disparity between victim and attacker. Nor do they care about what gender you are.. So we should feel guilty for being a male?  Honestly I\\u2019m afraid of going for a walk at 12 for the simple fact that I might possibly be accused of a crime that happened near where I\\u2019m walking and now I\\u2019m being slammed to the ground. I\\u2019m a black man also.  No privilege whatsoever.  However if it were a female they\\u2019d probably just ask if she\\u2019s seen anything and tell her to be safe.. No, no. I used to volunteer at the Samaritans. We would work late shifts all the time. Women got free taxis to and from their homes. But men? Nope. You either paid, drove or walked it yourself. No concern for our safety whatsoever.. Throw in murdered\\nIncarcerated\\nHomelessness \\nDrugs/alcohol addiction\\nKilled Battle fronts/fighting for their freedom \\nDying in the workplace \\nLess custody, child deprivation\\nAbortion choice\\nEarlier retirement\\nDying 4-5 years younger on average due to all the above also known as stress\\n\\nWhen I hear women\\u2019s shit I ask them if they\\u2019ve ever been punched in the face, never they say . \\nMy favorite is  \\u2018do they have their genitals mutilated and severed at birth?\\nMy body my choice, get the fuck out of here.\\n\\nAll this often met with radio silence.. Who walks at night? It\\u2019s much easier to walk other times of the day so you don\\u2019t trip on shit in your way because you can\\u2019t see it. Obviously this is a bigger issue for runners, but there\\u2019s even less reason for walking since there\\u2019s nothing to see. I would imagine 90% of the reason to walk at all is to enjoy your surroundings. If you want to look at a dark city or a dark sky, buy yourself a telescope.. Yeah, walking at midnight is dangerous, but you know what else men do...\\nr/WhyWomenLiveLonger. Who the fuck goes for a walk at midnight??!?. Women can walk at midnight however much they please.. **Women:** \\u201cI\\u2019m scared to walk alone at night because something bad might happen to me!\\u201d\\n\\n**Society:** \\u201cDon\\u2019t walk alone at night and put yourself in danger. Be safe and get a cab.\\u201d\\n\\n**Men:** \\u201cI\\u2019m scared to walk alone at night because something bad might happen to me!\\u201d\\n\\n**Society:** \\u201cYou\\u2019re a baby!\\u201d. I don't get it if I'm being completely honest.. Female solipsism is a true default in western society.. No just no.\",\n          \"Those two guys lost their scholarships and were suspended. Fuck this liar.. >\\u201cShe\\u2019s hanging in there,\\u201d lawyer Mark Sherman told The Post of Yovino, 19, of South Setauket.\\n\\nI don't want to hear it.  She is not the victim, she is the criminal. And her well being does not matter one bit after wrecking the lives of two innocent people. . No.   Go to jail.   Be an example.   You deserve it.\\n\\nSource;   I was falsely accused 5 years ago.. >Yovino eventually admitted that she\\u2019d had consensual sex with the two football players in a bathroom during a football club party, **then lied about it** in hopes of winning the sympathy of a third male student whom she wanted to date.\\n\\nIt would appear that  *women never lie about rape*  can't be true then.. Two men's lives were ruined. Fuck this bitch.. What a cunt, disgusting thing to accuse someone of. . It would be nice if they mentioned which jail diversion program she's being considered for and what the eligibility requirements are. As a therapist, I have a hard time understanding what mental health issue would contribute to you lying about rape for romantic attention that could also potentially be addressed in short-term treatment. Seems like the kind of thing that involves a personality disorder, which you're not going to get rid of in six months of therapy, and which should absolutely not be an acceptable reason to avoid jail. . Does this sub have a tag or an archive of some sort for the false rape accusation stories that happen up-to-date? I'm certain that if we kept track of them all to the best of our abilities, it would come in handy. It seems like there are a shit ton of them. I could never find the right number. Feminists say it's less than 6% (and they say it as if that's a low number, like a gotcha XD) and MRA's found the 40% figure. Either way, a succinct list of exactly who accused whom of rape falsely would at least show how prevalent it is.. *She's hanging in there..*\\n\\nWho gives a shit? Let her fucking rot in jail. . She should get the punishment rape gets, she is fucked up. Any news on the guys? Did they manage to recover at all after losing the scholarships? They say suspended but not outright kicked off the team. If they lost their scholarship, that is financial damages they should be able to take her to court over as well. I'm a woman and I never understand what would compel a girl to lie about being raped. That's not something you just casually mention to your friends, and it's not a way to get back at your ex.  What an insult to every victim of rape (and that includes both genders). . What message will this send to other people thinking about lying about being raped? That it's ok to do that and they will probably not face any consequences for their abhorrent behaviour.. Hello and welcome to /r/MensRights.

Anyone know if the 2 guys were granted back their scholarships?. The jail she would have gladly imposed on innocent men? . She ruins two men's lives and then begs to not get jail time? Fuck her, put her in prison with the rest of the scum.. This is why I am hesitant to believe rape stories.\\n\\nUnless there are 10 witnesses and Jesus Christ himself saying the girl was raped, I don't believe the stories.. >...then lied about it in hopes of winning the sympathy of a third male student whom she wanted to date.\\n\\n\\nWoooooooooooooooooow, well now you'll have lots of people looking to date you. No fucking way she should avoid jail for this.. It's women like this that fuck over men *and* women trying to report legitimate rapes. \\n\\nIf we're going to have each other's backs, it means we all have to play by the same rule.. My girlfriend lied and had me sent to jail for 4 days. I evicted her right after court!. I think she needs to be made an example of.. what a filthy lying whore.. 25 years is fair. Most should be in SHU for her own safety. Anyone heard any word if the two victims had their scholarships restored and/or team rosters?\\n\\nI honestly don't want to hear any more about this chick without some accompanying info about her victims.  The media seems to be treating them as unimportant. (That's a bit of hyperbole, I know damn well the victims did not have status restored) . If someone got me in jail by lying I would actually make anything possible to literally murder that person. When you file a false report like this, it should be automatic maximum penalty they would have gotten.\\n\\nSo if you accuse 2 people of rape and they're facing life each, you get two life sentences. . >  \\u201cShe\\u2019s looking for a result in this case that would not involve jail time.\\u201d\\n\\nFuck that shit. In what world is that an excuse when you commit a crime like that?. I'm normally the last person crying for harsh punishments, in general. \\nBut there needs to be a strong deterrent against false rape claims. The message needs to be that there *are* serious consequences.. Qualification for a diversion program does not require the judge to choose the diversion as part of her sentence.  Prison still seems appropriate at this point.. Well bitch, this is why some of us are disgusted we agree with Devos on dialing those protections back. Thanks for being the poster girl for this . Alternate headline falsely accused college students beg to avoid jail on a daily basis... this time their prayers are answered as accuser faces jail... I should avoid journalism. Go to jail and get the time of however long the 2 accused would have gone for.. She should just get whatever punishment they got or would have gotten. . Fat lying bitch whore. Nail her ass to the wall. Liar. . Please put her in jail. . HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\\n\\nno.. Jail time is harsh here but the dudes should sue for defamation and damages. Hell no.  She deserves the full five years.  Even though they have been admonished it should still be taken into account that she put their lives on hold. Five years would teach her that fake rape accusations are not ok for any reason.. This is not only unfortunate for men, but also for women who have actually been raped or assaulted. What a disgusting thing to lie about.. We need a registry for people who falsely accuse someone of rape. The should have to tell their neighbors. . >led to two Sacred Heart University football players losing their sports scholarships and getting suspended from their team.. /r/TwoXChromosomes . Fuck her. Interesting that only her mother appeared with her. Single-mother upbringing plus feminist miseducation perhaps? I'm a single father and if my daughter did something this stupid and criminal I'd go stand by her side in shame. Of course my daughter is an egalitarian and neither a feminist nor a narcissist. She's also not a liar and respects men so I doubt she'd ever do anything like that. . This is why Title IX needs to be changed.. Throw out the MRA, feminism, or egalitarian stuff people believe in. Point is that this woman took time, energy, and resources away from solving actual crimes that need to be solved. Because of her, time is wasted to solve an *actual* rape, an *actual* murder, an very real crime. Why are they wasting any more of their precious time and tax revenue on her?. Lock that cunt up.. Do the victims' privileges get restored in cases like this?    \\nIn this circumstance do they get their scholarships and sports rights back?. Sometimes I wonder if some psycho rapist keeps a register of these offenders. No one would believe them if they got raped after doing something so dumb.. Lock her up!. This is a reason why all rape accusers should have their picture, information and sexual history posted in the paper before a man is found guilty or innocent.. Nope. In she goes. If she is willing to ruin another persons life out of selfishness.... Has she already been registered in some Sex Offender Registry?. This case was continued yesterday:\\n\\n>[Nikki Yovino's lawyer filed an application for a probation program.](http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/Case-continued-for-woman-charged-with-making-12270771.php)\\n\\n(She insists in using her pass).\\n\\n. deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.4247  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/16532). Bitch please. I have a question for the therapists out there. I was a fed for five years and never had one of my arrestees plead insanity but I was told by several assistant U.S. attorneys I worked with that it rarely works out for them. I HAVE seen many of my defendants who were substance abusers exploit the system loopholes though. For example, during sentencing, they claim they aren't in their \\\"right mind\\\" to understand the charges/penalty the judge was handing down so they got stay after stay because the legal system is prohibited from sentencing someone who doesn't comprehend what they are being charged with. In this one case, the guy wanted to avoid prison and rather just stay in the local county jail. (For those of you who don't know, there is a big difference between prison and a jail. Prison is way worse even though they are both forms of incarceration.). This guy did this for three years and when he WAS finally sentenced, he got out with time served and never wound up actually going to prison.\\n\\nSo, my question is this: IS the insanity defense difficult to prove and have you seen that defense used to exploit the justice system in such a gross way?. They used to stone such women for good reasons. . Her parents must be proud!. Makes as much sense as a convicted rapist begging to not be sentenced to prison. Lock her up.. I don't think she will do any jail time,. Nope. Nope. Nope!\\n\\nShe lied and utterly *ruined* those guys lives!!\\n\\nShe should be glad it's jail and not *prison* !\\n\\n. There needs to be a set of laws specific to the women who pull this crap and there needs to be set jail sentences for it.  None of this crap about women getting away with this stuff or being given laughable sentences.  And I hope that women in the Trump admin follows through with getting rid of Title IX.  . The safest way to a man's heart is a rape story. . Anyone who falsely accuses another person of a crime should get the maximum sentence for conviction of that crime. As should any politician who votes in favor of criminalizing something that they later get caught doing. . now for the important stuff, what happened to the 2 guys? The actual victims. >\\\"One of the students has since been readmitted to the university, but he\\u2019s no longer a member of the football team and lost his scholarship. The names of the students are being withheld by Hearst Connecticut Media and one of their attorneys told the Connecticut Post that he just wants to put the incident behind him.\\\"<\\n\\nSo only one got readmitted and he now has to pay tuition himself. The university needs to bring both students back and pay their tuition. Its unacceptable to let her false accusation successfully ruin their lives any further. . Well if she dodges jail hopefully 1000 men accused of rape dodge jail too, because you know now juries know cunts lie about rape at the drop of a hat and all.. Can't wait to hear how this is a man's fault.. Lock her the fuck up. It's depressing that even if the courts decide you are not guilty that your life still gets destroyed. And the person who made a false claim often avoids prosecution of any kind . She deserves jail. She probably ruined their futures, and she ruined their collage years.  . # LISTEN AND BELIEVE. These \\\"women behaving badly\\\" posts have ruined this sub. They're the #1 thing driving fence-sitters away. People's biases are such that the only way to get misandry/sexism against men taken seriously is to hold *higher* intellectual standards than anyone else.\\n\\nA list of individual instances =/= solid statistical argument.. The only way I could see her avoiding jail is if she makes a public apology, the media print it and she actively goes around places trying to restore the reputation's of the men whose lives she's ruined and of course their scholarships.\\n\\n> During a brief hearing, a Bridgeport judge granted defendant Nikki Yovino\\u2019s request that her lawyer be present as she undergoes a psychological exam that will help determine her eligibility for the jail diversion program.\\n\\nNevermind, if she's going to try and plead insanity to stay out of jail that's never going to happen.. Are they getting back their scholarships now ? Plus gazillions from the inept law enforcement ?. Don't fuck this liar.. she'll make it look like rape. The liar needs to serve the maximum sentence.  If you lie like this and ruin someone else's lives, you must pay the price.  . The guy should get those scholarships back, AND be compensated for their grief.. Yeah she ruined these two lads futures. Not with just sports, but this will stigmatize every other pursuit aswell.. I completely agree. She lied and must accept the punishment. . I know it sounds bad, but you need to look at the context. She didn't do it out of malice, _she did it to gain the sympathy of another man_. \\n\\nThis is clearly a man's fault. Always remember women are wonderful and can do no wrong, citizen.. Shouldn't have raped that poor girl. Some girls get desperate man.... I'm sorry you had to go through something like this man. I wish only the best for you! . Damn, hope that person got what they deserved.. I mean, you shouldn't have put yourself in that position to begin with. I was never actually accused. But my freinds mom told my roommates mom that I would end up raping her. Made me feel so horrible. I can't imagine how you must feel. . Yep. Everyone in prison is innocent, too.. Oh shit, dude. If that happened to me I'd be so pissed I'd actually commit the crime cos I'll be going to jail anyway so.. But hey that's me. . It doesn't even make sense. Having compassion for someone is different than wanting to have sex with them. If anything, it would make a guy *more apprehensive* to make any kind of intimate advances.. What's sad is I've seen girls do it to one of my best friends. Saw them willingly hook up with him then the next day claim he did stuff to them out of shame. I've actually seen it a lot. It's really heartbreaking. .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

At the same time, higher class women of ancient Mesopotamia and Persian empires (non-Muslim civilisations) used to do that same thing. Assyria (another non-Muslim civilisations) had explicit sumptuary laws detailing which women must veil and which women must not, depending upon the woman's class, rank, and occupation in society. Female slaves and prostitutes were forbidden to veil and faced harsh penalties if they did so. In these ancient civilisations, gender based veiling was used to mark women as public property/privet property of men. In ancient non-Muslim civilisations, purpose of gender based veiling was not only to mark the aristocratic rank of the women, but also to differentiate between 'respectable' women and those who were publicly available. \n",

Muslim men learned this custom from their European counterparts and started to force their high born women to adopt it. Veiling and seclusion of women appear to have established themselves among Jews and Christians, before spreading to urban Arabs of the upper classes and eventually among the urban masses. Veiling of Arab Muslim women became especially pervasive under Ottoman rule as a mark of rank and exclusive lifestyle, and Istanbul of the 17th century witnessed differentiated dress styles that reflected geographical and occupational identities.\n",

Obviously people can wear what they choose, and the prejudice against Muslims is very real, but it’s unfortunate how you sometimes can’t even criticize Islam for its oppressive and harmful views without somehow being conflated with nut job racists. It’s a very strange thing, especially since many women living in countries free from Islam’s influence in the government still cannot choose to not wear the hijab as they risk being socially ostracized or even killed, albeit unlawfully.\n",
