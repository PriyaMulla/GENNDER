# GENNDER (Gender Exploration Neural Network, Data Extracted Reddit)

GENNDER is a seq2seq chatbot trained on data from any subreddit. Created for the purpose of exploring the construction of gender by generative AI on a small and controlled scale, GENNDER was used in my thesis, *Breaking into Binaries: Exploring AIâ€™s Constructions of Women and Feminist Perspectives on AI Interaction*.

## File Descriptions

- **GENNDER.ipynb**: train seq2seq model using dialogue pairs of reddit data, interact with produced chatbot, run sentiment analysis on chatbot responses
- **PRAW_reddit_data.ipynb**: get reddit discourse data based on a given subreddit
